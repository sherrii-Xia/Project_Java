# My Personal Project

## Project description 
This application is an online ordering system for restaurants.
It allows customers to order takeaway or dine in remotely.
Customers can use this to preview the meusï¼Œ
to let them view the menu,
select & select the food they want, and output the bill of that order. 




Basically, customers can preorder the food they want via this application even though they are not physically in the restaurant
This builds a practical preordering system that could be used in the real life, which motivates me. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see the ingredients of the dish (alergy ag)
- As a user, I want to select the food I want, and save it. 
- As a user, I want to delect the dish I don't want.
- As a user, I want to know the total amount of money the food I picked would cost.
