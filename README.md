# My Personal Project

## Project description 

What will the application do?

This application is an online ordering system for restaurants.
It allows customers to order takeaway or dine in remotely.
Basically, customers can preorder the food they want via this application even
though they are not physically in the restaurant

Who will use it?
Customers can use this to preview the menuï¼Œ
to let them view the menu,
select & select the food they want, and output the bill of that order. 


Why is this project of interest to you?
This builds a practical preorder system that could be used in the real life,
which motivates me.
